# 2 CHAINZ website demo
This is a text given by Halo Media when I am applying for their web developer position. My task is to implement a demo of a website based on one psd file.

## Description
This is my final work (all requirments and bonus and super bonus in two days):
1. I used bootstrap to make the website just looks like that shown in psd file.
2. I used `@media` and add some css code to make everything looks good in mobile or smaller screen.
3. I implement function of `LISTEN NOW` button. It would make screen scroll down to album part.
4. I put some mp3 file in the website so that if you click on the song name, there would be music (same one song).
5. I implement all social media button and link them to my homepage.
6. I put everything in `gulp` so that I can use a `scss` compiler and make website syncronized after I change any code.

## Next to do
Something else need to do but not required by the examiners:
1. I used defaut font everywhere.
2. I didn't collect enough news and images and songs about 2 CHAINZ so I just put same thing every where.

## How to run
1. Git clone the whole zip and go into it.
2. you can open `index.html` directly.
3. Or if you want to use `Gulp`, you can input `gulp` in terminal. The page would jump out automatically.
